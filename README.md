# Download simulator

Australia's National Broadband Network recently rolled out new internet plans that saw the previously
fastest 100 Mbps tier replaced with "Home Superfast" 250 Mbps and "Home Ultrafast" 1000 Gbps speeds.
I decided to create this app to simulate what downloading files would feel like at any given speed.

This app does not reflect a real world network transfer by a long shot but I thought it'd be a fun
way to demonstrate fast internet to those still stuck with 3rd world internet.
